"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fHh_8sP5COVlr3AY9HWwglX3Uruo6OcoY_PwDTpnTXA/edit","Deal Sheet Management","Help Document: Deal Sheet Management\nIntroduction\nA deal sheet is essential for starting projects, charging clients, paying consultants, and receiving commissions. It must be fully completed and all sections marked green to indicate readiness.\nCompleting a Deal Sheet\nRequirement: All sections of the deal sheet must be green, indicating all necessary information has been entered and validated.\nOutcome: Once completed, the project can commence, enabling billing and payments.\nActions Post-Completion of Deal Sheet\nThere are four primary actions that can be triggered after a deal sheet is completed:\nSupersede\nRenew\nDNS (Did Not Start)\nEarly Terminate\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n1. What does it mean to supersede a deal sheet?\nAnswer: Superseding a deal sheet involves creating a new deal sheet to replace an existing one. This action is necessary when changes are needed after the original deal sheet has been approved and completed.\n2. How do I renew a deal sheet?\nAnswer: Renewing a deal sheet extends the duration of an existing project by creating a new deal sheet with a new end date. The start date of the new deal sheet will be the day after the end date of the original deal sheet.\n3. What is DNS (Did Not Start), and when is it used?\nAnswer: DNS is used when a project, for some reason, does not commence despite the deal sheet being completed. It could be due to budget constraints, project cancellation, or other factors. A deal sheet marked as DNS cannot be reactivated; a new deal sheet must be created for any future work.\n4. How is early termination different from DNS?\nAnswer: Early termination is used when a project has started (indicated by the presence of timesheets) but needs to be concluded prematurely. It effectively ends the deal sheet and, like DNS, requires the creation of a new deal sheet for any subsequent activities.\n5. Can a deal sheet be renewed or superseded multiple times?\nAnswer: Yes, deal sheets can be renewed or superseded as needed, depending on project requirements and changes. Each action creates a new deal sheet with updated information.\n6. What happens after early termination of a deal sheet?\nAnswer: After early termination, the deal sheet is concluded, and no further actions can be taken on it. For any continued or new work, a new deal sheet must be generated.\n7. Are there any specific requirements for completing a deal sheet?\nAnswer: Yes, all sections of the deal sheet must be marked green, indicating that all required information has been entered. Additionally, for certain actions like DNS, there should be no timesheets attached to the deal sheet.\n8. How do I handle errors or bugs when completing a deal sheet?\nAnswer: If you encounter errors or suspect a bug (e.g., a required action like PO request not appearing), report the issue to the technical team for investigation and resolution.\nThis document aims to provide clarity on managing deal sheets and addressing common queries. For further assistance or specific cases not covered here, please contact the support team.\n\n"
